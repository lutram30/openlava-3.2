Release notes for OpenLava versions

3.2.1
======
-- Fix the parsing algorithm for compact host name.
-- Fix a bug in bmgroup where by mistake the -s and -r options were dropped.
-- Update bmgrop and bugroup man pages.
-- Enlarge the -J name job name to be at leat 1024 characters.

3.2.0
======
-- Fix main Makefile.am to include the m4 directory.

3.2.beta1
=========
-- Hosts member od a host group can now be specified in a compact format
   for example: (ol[1-3]).
-- Implement configure option --enable-debug. If set the compilation will
   have the -Werror option enabled. By default this option is not set.

3.2.pre
========
-- badmin ckconfig/reconfig displays configuration error and warning
   messages.
-- bsub/bmod/brestart -h displays usage information.
-- Added USER_SHARES information in lsb.users.5
-- Add lsclusters command.
-- Use qsort() to sort jobs in MBD this improves the performance
   of replay and general bsub operations.
-- Introduce a getc2() functions to read lsb.events in memory
   before parsing it.
-- Reduce the number of malloc operations when reading the
   lsb.events file.
-- Implement memory reservation if the queue has SLOT_MEMORY_RESERVE configured
   and the job requests rusage of memory. The jobs has to reserve slots
   on the hosts as well.
-- Implement a correct switching of the lim.events file.
-- Update the bmgroup command to display GROUP_SLOT and MAX_SLOTS
   sections if configured.
-- Update the bqueues command to display slot and memory reservation.
-- Allow batch hosts configured in lsb.hosts to be specified in a
   compact form, i.e. ol[1-3] the mbatchd will expand example this into 3
   hosts ol1, ol2, ol3.
-- Allow OpenLava to use cores as cpus regardless is the machines has
   hyperthreads or not. To enable this behaviour set the variable
   LIM_DEFINE_NCPUS=cores|threads in lsf.conf. Default is threads.
-- Fix bsub bug in which if user specify -n min,max the max was ignored.
-- Make fairshare configuration compatible with the LSF one.

3.1.4
======

-- Fix the problem that if the order of events in lim.events is not correct
   LIM may core dump.
-- Change the ownership of the mbatchd log file to avoid messages going
   to syslog messages file.
-- Prevent LIM from core dumping in findHost() if the input name is NULL.
-- Enable the secondary admin to run 'badmin reconfig'.
-- Fix res nios protocol to pass the correct taskid to nios.

3.1.3
======
-- Corrected the lsf.cluster man page describing LIM communication
   parameters.
-- Enable LIM communication debugging using LC_COMM class and
   LOG_INFO level.
-- Fix bug in announceMaster() which was slowing down announcement
   of slave hosts.
-- Fix a bug in the slave host timer causing slave to send load
   to master more frequently then necessary.
-- Fix counter update in fairshare policy when jobs are suspended
   and resumed.
-- Remove spurious res log messages.

3.1.2
=====
-- Fix a critical mbatchd bug when sorting queues.
-- Enable the openlava.spec file and the rpm.sh script
   which builds the rpm.

3.1.1
=====
-- Fix scheduling bug in which performance could drop if the lowest
   priority queue was always full.
-- Fix the incorrect encoding of bchkpnt command data structure.

3.1.0
======
-- Modify openlava.sh to forcefully terminate sbatchd if SIGTERM does
   not work.
-- Fix LIM bug in which the code was accessing non initialized memory.
-- Fix several memory leaks in LIM.
-- Fix res hang in child handler.
-- Fix memory corruption in mbatchd when dealing with rusage.
-- Fix mbatchd child core dump when processing bugroup command.
-- Improve fairshare performance.
-- Introduce an lsf.conf parameter MBD_MAX_JOB_SCHED which allows site
   to configure how many jobs should MBD attempt to schedule per cycle.
   Typically two times the number of slots.
-- Introduce an lsf.conf parameter MBD_QSORT_JOBS which changes the way
   jobs are inserted and sorted in the PJL. This parameter avoids searching
   the job list upon a new job arrival speeding up the submission and overall
   MBD operations.
-- Fix issues in the job sorting order while using qsort().
-- Increase the array size of LIM clients from 64 to 2014.
-- Fix lim core dump if the lim receives an operation request from
   outside of the OL cluster and it is not LIM_ADD_HOST.
-- Fix bsub < file which was not creating the shell file correctly.
-- Fix rusage bug in which the host could be allocated to a job even with
   not enough resources.
-- Fix memory error in mbatchd when computing job's rusage.
-- Fix various memory leaks

3.1pre1
=======

-- Removed obsolete mls code and infrastructure simplifying user
   management.
-- No longer run mbatchd as root. The uid of the daemon is the one
   of the primary lsb manager.
-- Support memory contraining using cgroup for batch jobs.
-- Developed a built in resource names 'slots' used by mbatchd only.
   This resource allows to pack or stripe jobs on hosts.
-- Developed the rusage or functionality. -R "rusage[x=1||y=2]".
-- Introduced LSB_PROJECT_NAME variable in job and preexec environment.
-- Developed the host group based slot resources. A host group can have
   a resource which represents the number of available slots in that
   group. An oridnary shared resource is configured in the base
   files but also in lsb.hosts in the group section. No elim is needed
   to collect this resource as mbatchd computes the slots automatically.
-- Introduce a mutex to protect critical section in the syslog library.
-- lsaddhost has a new -M option. This indicates the MXJ that should be
   assigned to the batch host, this also sets the number of CPUS available
   on the batch host.
-- Improve scheduling performance when jobs use shared resources.
-- Improve rusage syntax parsing, now spaces between operands are ignored
   and mbatchd does not syntax error.
-- Keep updating man pages.
-- Add the environment variable LSB_EFFECTIVE_RUSAGE. In case a job is using
   the rusage or feature this variable indicates which or clause evaluated
   true dispatching the job.
-- Fix fairshare bug which prevented jobs from being scheduled if groups
   had different shares.
-- Added support for client only hosts. These are host that do not run
   OpenLava daemons but can run commands and submit jobs.
-- Fix mbatchd bug that limited the output and error file to 80 characters
   of length.
-- Enlarged MAXLSFNAMELEN to 1024.
-- Introduce cpu binding using sched_setaffinity()/sched_getaffinity(),
   this feature is enabled by setting SBD_BIND_CPU=y in lsf.conf.
-- Introduced LOAD_UPDATE_INTVL parameter in lsb.params. It controls how
   often MBD calls LIM to update load and shared resources. The default
   value is 15 seconds. Smaller the value and faster is the scheduler
   response to changes in resource values.
-- Fix MBD job lists bug preventing preemption from working correctly.
-- Add -rdynamic option to gcc as new compiler (4.8.3)don't set it by default.
-- Fix the limitation of the select() system call which can handle only 1024
   simultaneous connections. Use poll() instead.
-- Fix potential buffer overrun in lim when running elim.
-- Modify bparams and mbatchd to display maxSbdConnections.
-- Added a new feature MAX_SLOTS in lsb.hosts which is the upper limit
   for the number of usable slots in a hostgroup. The parameter GROUP_SLOTS
   must be enabled in lsb.hosts.
-- Fix wrong calculation of fairshare free slots in the bqueues -l display.

3.0.1
======

-- Fix bug in openlava.in, the variable err was incorrectly defined.
-- Fix xdr version number bug in lsb.xdr.c
-- Fix hostID bug which prevented queue JL/H from working properly.
-- Allow comma as separator together with colon when rusage is
   specified. e.g -R rusage[mem=1,vcs=2]
-- Fix the bug which prevented bsub -K from working.
-- Add script for Intel MPI.
-- Fix mbatchd core dump if the preemption plugin cannot be loaded.
-- Link daemons and commands statically so there is no need to
   set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the environment.
-- Add LSF_LIBDIR in the lsf.conf.in template.
-- Fix mbatchd core dump when replying partially cleaned job arrays.
-- Modify the resource requirement parser to handle compact syntax,
   like select[swp>1].
-- Implement lim -t to print the architecture, model, cores, sockets
   number of cpus and bogomips of the machine where lim is running.
-- Fix the bug in which sbatchd was logging post exec failure even if
   the post exec ran fine.
-- Reduce or remove sleep times in res.
-- Implement sorting by MXJ in mbatchd.
-- Implement sorting by cpu factor in mbatchd.
-- Fix bjobs -pl core dump.
-- Fix bug in job lists management which leads to mbatchd core dumps.

3.0
====

Major release which includes hierarchical slot fairshare and preemption.

3.0beta
=======
-- Queue level preemption
-- Queue level fairshare
-- Fix LIM core dump when lim.events has bad format
-- Ignore PREEMPTABLE keyword in lsb.queues
-- Implement bpost/bread commands using API
   lsb_msgjob()/lsb_getmsgjob().
-- Implement docker integration
-- Rename the lsb_msgjob()/lsb_getmsgjob() to
   lsb_postjobmsg()/lsb_readjobmsg() for compatibility
-- Fix bug in which every user can shutdown LIM.

2.3-0rc
========
-- Fix the problem of host going periodically -ok.
-- Fix timer initialization in LIM.
-- Fix mbatchd to clean HOST_STAT_EXCLUSIVE when reply lsb.events.
-- Fix job dependencies by name. The dependencies by name incorrectly
   included all jobs belong to the user submitting the jobs.
-- The daemons are not using privilege ports anymore even if
   running as root.
-- Reduce the RES_SLEEP_TIME from 30s to 15s to avoid hosts appearing
   as not available in lim.
-- Remove obsolete INTER_DAEMON_AUTH define.
-- Remove the need for privilege port between res and lim.

2.2
====
-- RPM files are no longer distributed, however they can still be built
   from the tarball.
-- When migrant hosts are added or removed, we must increment or
   decrement the numHosts field in the struct clusterNode (myClusterPtr)
   to allow the periodic master announcement to be sent to dynamic
   nodes in the cluster on master lim restart.
-- Don't call select in rd_select_() when the input file descriptor
   is less than zero, as this causes a buffer overflow abort when
   openlava is built with fortify for debian packages.
-- Fix core dump in bjobs. Since 2.1 hostid start from 0.
-- Fixed a typo in the lsf.cluster man page.
-- Print correct pending reason when hostid is 0.
-- Corrected HACKING file.
-- make install no longer installs the configuration file, this avoids
   overwriting production configuration files.
-- Added -fPIC option to configure.ac - needed when compiling the object
   code into a library for use in third party tools.
-- Fixed bsub -I, now the the job data are correcty sent to the
   user terminal and viceversa.
-- Accept `DESTDIR` environment variable, allowing staged installs.
-- Avoid announcing all LIMs at the same time.
-- Install the config.h in include directory.
-- Fixed lshosts -l core dump.
-- Change the behaviour of the SBD SIGCHLD handler. By default, the
   handler would sleep for 1 second for each child reaped, which would
   cause long waits on machines with lots of slots when lots of jobs
   finished at the same time (e.g. lots of short jobs). The default is
   now to not sleep at all.
-- Count cached memory as free memory.
-- Added error exit message for missing ncurses.h
-- Added MANPATH to shell profile scripts.
-- Allow multiple hosttypes and hostmodels in the shared and cluster file.
   LIM now can be configured with any type and model.
